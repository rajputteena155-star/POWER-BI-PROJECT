# Inflation Trend Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview

* This project is all about **understanding how inflation behaves in India**.
* Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard that tracks **CPI (Consumer Price Index)** and **WPI (Wholesale Price Index)** trends from **2015 to 2025**.
* The dashboard doesn’t just show numbers – it helps explain **why prices rise, which sectors drive inflation, and how different states are impacted differently**.
* The broader aim: to show how **economics isn’t just theory**, but something that actively shapes policies, businesses, and even the food we buy every day.

## 🎯 Key Features

* **Trends that speak:** Year-on-year and month-on-month changes in CPI & WPI.
* **Basket breakdown:** See which groups (food, fuel, housing, etc.) push inflation the most.
* **State comparisons:** Discover why some states like **Telangana** consistently stay low, while others like **Lakshadweep** face higher inflation.
* **Smart DAX measures:**

  * *CALCULATE()* – to get dynamic inflation measures.
  * *FILTER()* – to zoom into state/sector trends.
  * *AVERAGEX()* – for weighted averages across categories.
  * *SWITCH()* – to show different inflation types in one measure.

## 📊 Methodology

* **Data Source:** MOSPI official CPI & WPI datasets (2015–2025).
* **Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX, Excel for cleaning and preprocessing.
* **Process:** Clean data → Import to Power BI → Build measures → Design visuals → Extract insights.

## 🔑 Insights & Learnings

* **Food & beverages** dominate India’s inflation basket – reminding us how important agriculture and supply chains are.
* **Telangana’s lower inflation** reflects better supply efficiency, while **Lakshadweep’s higher inflation** highlights logistical and import challenges.
* **WPI dipped negative in June 2025** – largely due to falling global commodity and crude oil prices.
* The data during **COVID years shows unusual spikes and dips** – instead of being a flaw, this helps us understand how unexpected shocks reshape the economy and teach policymakers valuable lessons.

## 🌍 Why This Matters Today

* Inflation affects **purchasing power, wages, savings, and government budgets** – basically everything that touches our lives.
* Businesses use inflation insights for **pricing and investment strategies**.
* Governments rely on it for **policies, subsidies, and welfare schemes**.
* For citizens, it creates awareness about why costs rise and how to plan better.
* In short, inflation analysis makes economics **practical, relatable, and action-driven**.

## 📂 Deliverables

* Power BI dashboard with interactive visuals.
* Cleaned dataset (Excel).
* Documentation of all DAX formulas.
* Summary report with key findings and policy takeaways.
